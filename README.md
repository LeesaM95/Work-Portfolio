# Work-Portfolio

## Installation
This website is supposed to showcase any work I've done for both school and work with the ability to add more sections for possible companies to browse during an interviewing process. The CSS is meant to be as condensed and easy to follow as possible with clear direction as to where, and what, each class, id, and element is being styled. Each image on the site has an alt tag for accessibility purposes.

## Usage
Users can view this portfolio website to view examples of my professional work in the future during the hiring process. 

## Visuals
Screenshots of the HTML and CSS codes will be available below as well as a link to the website. 

## Contributions
The entire code has been written by me with references from school projects. The banner image was sourced from Freepik.
